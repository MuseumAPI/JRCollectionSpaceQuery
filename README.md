# JRCollectionSpaceQuery
CollectionSpace query executer for Jasper Report

The main idea behind development of this adapter was, with minimum modifications of the current jasper reports files, to be able to use SOLR as an unique datasource for all reports in iReport instead of writing a SQL request for every and each of them.
